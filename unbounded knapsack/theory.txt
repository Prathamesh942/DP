Unbounded knapsack -> you can select multiple instances of same item

same as 0-1 knapsack but just a slight change in recurrence relation

j represent capacity
i  represent selecting from i items

BASE CASE
dp[i][0] = 0;
dp[0][j] = 0;

withselect = 0; 
withoutselect = dp[i-1][j];
if(wt[i-1] <= j) withselect = dp[i][j-wt[i-1]] + val[i-1]

dp[i][j] = max(withselect, withoutselect);
